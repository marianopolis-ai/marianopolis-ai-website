<!-- ## Our plan for the academic year of 2023-2024 -->

## Out plan for Winter 2024

<br>

> **NOTE:** This is a general outline of our roadmap and is subject to change at all times.

### Week 1-2 (Early February): Introduction to Pandas

We will cover the basics of Pandas, a popular open-source Python library providing data structures and tools for data manipulation and analysis widely used in machine learning and data science. We will go over the primary Pandas data structures as well as data import/export, preprocessing and statistical explorations. 

### Week 3-5 (Mid February - Early March): Supervised learning: Scikit-Learn and shallow learning

We will start working with Scikit-learn and cover some classic machine learning techniques such as linear and logistic regression, decision trees, k-nearest neightbours ... and start implementing and training the models using real-world datasets. 

### Week 6-8 (Mid March - April): Supervised learning: TensorFlow and Deep Learning

In a couple of workshops, we will work with TensorFlow and Keras to create and train neural networks, with hands-on experience working on projects.

We will go over some deep learning topics such as:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and computer vision
- performance evaluation of different models
- hyperparameter tuning and optimization
- introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)

<!-- ## Week 1-2 (Early September): Python (Local / Colab)

- Introduction to the Python Programming Language (variables, for loops, while loops, if statements)
- Intermediate/ Advanced Python (file manipulation, dictionaries, lists, and more!)
- Projects : Guess the number game, Caesar Cipher, and a namecard

## Week 3-6 (Mid September - Early October): Matplotlib, Keras, CNN, Streamlit, Tensorflow.js

- Introduction to the Matplotlib plotting library
- Introduction to Keras, a library to create neural networks in Python
- Evaluation of neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNN) on MNIST and CIFAR-100
- Deployment of model using both tensorflow.js and streamlit online
- Projects: Handwriting analyser website using tf.js and p5.js and build more standard neural networks

NOTE: There will be a Halloween special event with free treats as well!

## Week 7-10 (Mid October - Mid November): Working with Vision: Transfer Learning, VGG, ResNet, GANs, CGAN, and more! 

- Introduction to more modern CNN architectures in Keras with transfer learning
- Introduction to GANs (generative adversarial networks) for art / image generation
- Projects: Tumor Detection from Chest X Ray, Real Time Image Detection of many objects, Face ID, Art / Face Generation using GAN

## Week 10-12 (Mid November - December) : Working with Text! RNN, LSTM, and Transformers

- Introduction to embeddings: word2vec, GloVe, sent2vec, and doc2vec.
- Introduction to RNN, LSTM, GRU and Transformers for natural language processing
- Projects: Sentiment Analysis Detector, Poem Writer, Natural Chatbot -->
