# Our plan for the academic year of 2022-2023
**NOTE:** This is a general outline of our roadmap, it will get updated with the relevant information.
## Week 1-2 (Early September): Python (Local / Colab)
- Introduction to the Python Programming Language (variables, for loops, while loops, if statements)
- Intermediate/ Advanced Python (file manipulation, dictionaries, lists, and more!)
- Projects : Guess the number game, Caesar Cipher, and a namecard

## Week 3-6 (Mid September - Early October): Matplotlib, Keras, CNN, Streamlit, Tensorflow.js
- Introduction to the Matplotlib plotting library
- Introduction to Keras, a library to create neural networks in Python
- Evaluation of neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNN) on MNIST and CIFAR-100
- Deployment of model using both tensorflow.js and streamlit online
- Projects: Handwriting analyser website using tf.js and p5.js and build more standard neural networks

NOTE: There will be a Halloween special event with free treats as well!

## Week 7-10 (Mid October - Mid November): Working with Vision: Transfer Learning, VGG, ResNet, GANs, CGAN, and more! 
- Introduction to more modern CNN architectures in Keras with transfer learning
- Introduction to GANs (generative adversarial networks) for art / image generation
- Projects: Tumor Detection from Chest X Ray, Real Time Image Detection of many objects, Face ID, Art / Face Generation using GAN


## Week 10-12 (Mid November - December) : Working with Text! RNN, LSTM, and Transformers
- Introduction to embeddings: word2vec, GloVe, sent2vec, and doc2vec.
- Introduction to RNN, LSTM, GRU and Transformers for natural language processing
- Projects: Sentiment Analysis Detector, Poem Writer, Natural Chatbot

## Winter Semester:
- To be determined!! (Maybe Reinforcement Learning or Graph Neural Networks)
