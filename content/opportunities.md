# AI Launch Lab Fall/ Winter Program 2022-2023 Edition

TLDR : Work and learn on artifical intelligence projects with industry and academic experts

❓ What
---
You will be working on one (or multiple) project(s) that inspire you. You can select a project from a predefined list (ideas from industry partners), or you can propose your own project. You will be mentored by experts, such as industry experts, MILA (https://mila.quebec/en/) Master and Ph.D. students. We know that CEGEP can be busy, so our exclusive Marianopolis program does not require you to commit a minimum number of hours per week (although it is best to spend at least 5 hours per week to optimize the learning experience)

⏰ When
---
Fall semester from September 2022 to November 2022 and Winter Edition during the 2023 Winter!

> NOTE: projects will be done during the Winter Semester and NOT the fall semester.

💡 Why:
---
Awesome learning and networking experience! + you could get hired by the company that proposed the project or by the mentors you’ve met throughout the program!
