We're working on collaborations with other clubs and organizations, so stay tuned for updates! Also check out the [Marianopolis Programming Club](https://mariprogramming.vercel.app/) and [MariHacks](https://www.marihacks.com/) :)

Some opportunities offered in the past:

- AI Launch Lab program

<!-- # AI Launch Lab Fall/ Winter Program 2022-2023 Edition

TLDR : Work and learn on artifical intelligence projects with industry and academic experts

❓ What
---
You will be working on one (or multiple) project(s) that inspire you. You can select a project from a predefined list (ideas from industry partners), or you can propose your own project. You will be mentored by experts, such as industry experts, MILA (https://mila.quebec/en/) Master and Ph.D. students. We know that CEGEP can be busy, so our exclusive Marianopolis program does not require you to commit a minimum number of hours per week (although it is best to spend at least 5 hours per week to optimize the learning experience)

⏰ When
---
- Fall semester from September 2022 to November 2022 and Winter Edition during the 2023 Winter!
- Virtual workshops every Saturday during those weeks!

> NOTE: projects will be done during the Winter Semester and NOT the fall semester.

💡 Why:
---
Awesome learning and networking experience! + you could get hired by the company that proposed the project or by the mentors you’ve met throughout the program!
