❓ What
---
You will be working on one (or multiple) project(s) that inspire you. You can select a project from a predefined list (ideas from industry partners), or you can propose your own project. You will be mentored by experts, such as industry experts, MILA (https://mila.quebec/en/) Master and Ph.D. students. We know that CEGEP can be busy, so our exclusive Marianopolis program does not require you to commit a minimum number of hours per week (although it is best to spend at least 5 hours per week to optimize the learning experience)
:clock:  When Fall semester from September 2021 to November 2021. There will be a second edition of this program during the Winter semester!

💡 Why:
---
Awesome learning and networking experience! + you could get hired by the company that proposed the project or by the mentors you’ve met throughout the program!
