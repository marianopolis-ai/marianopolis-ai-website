# ðŸ¥³ Welcome to the Marianopolis AI Club
The Marianopolis AI Club is dedicated to foster young talents in artificial intelligence, most notably in the fields of machine learning and deep learning. We host **weekly workshops** ranging from topics such as an introduction to the Python programming language to more in-depth topics such as computer vision and natural language processing. 
This club is **beginner-friendly** and aims to provide quality education and fun to all those who are interested in artificial intelligence.
